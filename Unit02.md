**Unit 2: Classical Cryptography** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, we will learn to describe and analyze the following
classical ciphers:* *ADFGVX, Affine, Beaufort, Bifid, Caesar, Columnar
Transposition, Four-Square, Hill, Playfair, Polybius Square, Rail-fence,
Simple Substitution, Straddle Checkerboard, Vigenere, Autokey, Enigma,
and Lorenz ciphers.nz ciphers.  These ciphers are intuitively easy to
understand and seem to encrypt the message well, but they have many
shortcomings, which we will discuss as we work through this unit.  By
studying these classical ciphers, you will learn to avoid poor cipher
design.*

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: If you do not have java compiler on your computer,
    install Java on your computer via
    [www.java.com](http://www.java.com/).   Then, create Caesar cipher
    with java.  You can see how to compile a java code via the java
    tutorials provided at
    [download.oracle.com](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/cupojava/win32.html). 
    One possible solution can be found via the link above, under the
    Caesar section.  Study the solution code only after you have solved
    the problem or spent a substantial amount of time working on it (it
    could take you up to 9 hours).
