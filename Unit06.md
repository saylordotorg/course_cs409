**Unit 6: Elliptic Curve Cryptography** <span id="6"></span> 
*This unit will cover elliptic curve cryptography.  This approach to
public-key cryptography is based on the algebraic structure of elliptic
curves over finite fields.  This unit includes examples of elliptic
curves over the field of real numbers.  The next unit will explain the
Diffie-Hellman key exchange as the most important example of
cryptographic protocol for symmetric key exchange.  In the last part of
this unit, we will learn about the elliptic curve discrete logarithm
problem, which is the cornerstone of much of present-day elliptic curve
cryptography.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 12 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 6.1: 5 hours

☐    Subunit 6.2: 7 hours

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Define the Elliptic Curve and explain what it is used for.
-   Describe the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
-   Explain the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm problem.
