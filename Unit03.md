**Unit 3: Block Ciphers** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, we will start with an explanation of the
substitution-permutation network, which works through the series of
linked mathematical operations used in block cipher algorithms.  Note
that substitution-permutation networks take a block of plain text and
the key as inputs and then apply several alternating rounds of
substitution and permutation boxes to encipher the data. *  
  
 *This unit also uses the complete mathematical algorithm to describe
the data encryption standard before finishing with a description of the
advanced encryption standard for a symmetric-key encryption adopted by
the U.S. government.*
