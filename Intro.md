Course Syllabus for "CS409: Cryptography"
-----------------------------------------

Cryptography is essentially the science of writing in secret code.  In
data and telecommunications, cryptography has specific security
requirements, such as authentication, privacy or confidentiality,
integrity, and non-repudiation.  To meet these security requirements, we
employ secret key (or symmetric) cryptography, public-key (or
asymmetric) cryptography, and hash functions. In the first part of the
course, we will review a number of different ciphers that were used
before World War II.  These ciphers would be easily broken nowadays,
since cryptography has advanced quickly over the past couple of decades
with the advent of modern computers.  We will cover block cipher
algorithms and describe the advanced encryption standard for a
symmetric-key encryption adopted by the U.S. government.  We will also
learn about the important MD5 and SHA-1 hash functions as well as the
message authentication code. This course will focus on public key
cryptography, which is best exemplified by the RSA algorithm (named
after the algorithm inventors Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman).  The RSA
algorithm is considered particularly strong due to the fact that it
relies on prime factorization, a computationally difficult process. We
will take a careful look at this algorithm in this course.  We will also
learn about elliptic curves, another important mathematical function in
cryptography, as well as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the
elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. In the final part of the
course, we will cover key exchange methods, study signature schemes, and
provide an overview and discussion of public key infrastructure. Note:
It is strongly recommended that you complete Abstract Algebra I
([MA231](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma231/)) before taking this
course.
