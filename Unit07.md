**Unit 7: Digital Signature and Entity Authentication** <span
id="7"></span> 
*This unit begins with a general discussion of key exchange methods, or
methods designed to distribute keys securely so that they can be later
used in a cryptographic algorithm.  This unit also describes the
difficult problem of computing the discrete logarithm, which is of
greatly interest to cryptologists by virtue of its ElGamal signature
scheme. *  
  
 *The unit will then cover five additional schemes (trusted
certificates, private certificates, a modified Schnorr algorithm, a
modified Guillou-Quisquater algorithm, and a modified Mu-Varadharajan
algorithm) before ending with an overview and discussion of public key
infrastructure and a lecture by James Massey.*
